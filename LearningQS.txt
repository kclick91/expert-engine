An algorithm for learning concepts.
First,start with a queue where the First in are First out. 
Connect the queue to a stack(a stack to the mind but a queue to the queue) where the Last in is First out.

The queue checks if there is an easy opportunity for learning and if so integrate concept A with your mind, 
otherwise send A to the stack and remove when A is reached and learned. This gives time for more concepts to be 
learned to make it easier for the concepts at the bottom of the stack that will be revisited later to be learned.
Easier means faster. A max size could be decided for both the queue and stack so it is not overwhelming 
in the queue and nothing gets buried in the stack. Also, the bottom of the stack could be connected to the front of the 
queue so as to check for new ways to understand the concept.

So overall the first structure is a queue to the mind or a queue to the second structure depending on how easy something is to learn. 
The second structure is a stack to the mind but a queue to the first structure forming a 
cycle back to the first structure.
