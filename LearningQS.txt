An algorithm for learning concepts.
First,start with a queue where the First in are First out. 
Connect the queue to a stack where the Last in is First out.

The queue checks if there is an easy opportunity for learning and if so integrate concept A with your mind, 
otherwise send A to the stack and remove when A is reached and learned. This gives time for more concepts to be 
learned to make it easier for the concepts at the bottom of the stack that will be revisited later to be learned.
Easier means faster. A max size could be decided for both the queue and stack so it is not overwhelming 
in the queue and nothing gets buried in the stack.
