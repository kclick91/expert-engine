A Human Algorithm for Learning and Thinking

## Philosophy

Continuous merging of human thinking and computing.

The combination of certainty and relevance combined with the combination of breadth and depth. 
This makes a distinction between how much of your knowledge seems to be related to something and how much
do you know about that something. Both take introspection and quantities come from the introspection alone.

Also, in general, the philosophy of expert-engine is that making decisions with something is the best way to learn it.

LearningQS is used to choose what to learn.

## Algorithm

1. LearningQS
2. Choose a topic, concept, or something you know about
3. Understand the breadth of certainty. Ex. How many cities do you know about?
4. Understand the breadth of relevance. Ex. How much of your knowledge is related to cities?
5. Understand the depth of certainty. Ex. How much do you know about specific cities or a specific city, e.g. your hometown?
6. Understand the depth of relevance. Ex. How much of your knowledge is related to specific cities or a specific city, e.g. your hometown?
7. Adjust each as needed.
8. Adjust external decision making as needed.
9. Repeat steps 2-8 until concept is learned.
10. Return to LearningQS

      Certainty     /    Relevance
      
Depth   |    Quantity   |    Quantity   |

Breadth  |    Quantity  |    Quantity   |
