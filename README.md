A Human Algorithm for Learning and Thinking

## Philosophy
 
Learn from computing in order to work with the limitations of wetware.

## Algorithm

1. LearningQS
2. Choose a topic, concept, or something you know about
3. Understand the breadth of certainty. Ex. How many cities do you know about?
4. Understand the breadth of relevance. Ex. How much of your knowledge is related to cities?
5. Understand the depth of certainty. Ex. How much do you know about specific cities or a specific city, e.g. your hometown?
6. Understand the depth of relevance. Ex. How much of your knowledge is related to specific cities or a specific city, e.g. your hometown?
7. Adjust each as needed.
8. Adjust external decision making as needed.
9. Repeat steps 2-8 until concept is learned.
10. Return to LearningQS

      Certainty     /    Relevance
      
Depth   |    Quantity   |    Quantity   |

Breadth  |    Quantity  |    Quantity   |
