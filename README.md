A Human Algorithm for Learning and Thinking

## Philosophy
 
Learn from the hardware and software limitations of computing in order to work with the limitations of wetware.

## Limitations of Wetware
1. Cannot multitask
2. Limited working memory along with limited memory
3. Speed of problem solving
4. Speed of learning
5. Biases
6. Fallacies

* Possibly, conservation of connectivity
* Possibly, physical constraints

## Algorithm

1. LearningQS
2. Choose a topic, concept, or something you do not know about
3. Understand the breadth of certainty. Ex. How many cities do you know about?
4. Understand the breadth of relevance. Ex. How much of your knowledge is related to cities?
5. Understand the depth of certainty. Ex. How much do you know about specific cities or a specific city, e.g. your hometown?
6. Understand the depth of relevance. Ex. How much of your knowledge is related to specific cities or a specific city, e.g. your hometown?
7. Adjust each as needed.
8. Adjust external decision making as needed.
9. Repeat steps 3-9 until concept is learned.
10. Return to LearningQS

      Certainty     /    Relevance
      
Depth   |    Quantity   |    Quantity   |

Breadth  |    Quantity  |    Quantity   |


## Example with Programming Languages

1. Insert Java into queue
2. Insert C++ into queue
3. Insert Python into queue
4. Choose Java to learn
5. Understand the breadth of certainty of Java and expand on it.
6. Understand the breadth of relevance of Java and expand on it.
7. Understand the depth of certainty of Java and expand on it.
8. Understand the depth of relevance of Java and expand on it.
9. Adjust external decision making
10. Repeat 4 - 9 as necessary
---Reward---
11. Choose C++ to learn(Similar to 5-8 but for C++)
12. Add it to the second structure because it is taking a long time
13. 5 - 8 for Python
---Reward---
14. Add C to first structure(which ends up helping with C++)
15. 5 - 8 for C
---Reward---
16. Send C++ to first structure
17. 5 - 8 for C++
---Reward---
18. Continue...
