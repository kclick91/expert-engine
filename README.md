A Human Algorithm for Learning and Thinking

## Philosophy

The combination of certainty and relevance combined with the combination of breadth and depth. 
This makes a distinction between how much of your knowledge seems to be related to something and how much
do you know about that something. Both take introspection and quantities come from the introspection alone.

## Algorithm

1. Choose a topic, concept, or something you know about
2. Understand the breadth of certainty. Ex. How many cities do you know about?
3. Understand the breadth of relevance. Ex. How much of your knowledge is related to cities?
4. Understand the depth of certainty. Ex. How much do you know about specific cities or a specific city, e.g. your hometown?
5. Understand the depth of relevance. Ex. How much of your knowledge is related to specific cities or a specific city, e.g. your hometown?
6. Adjust each as needed.
7. Adjust external decision making as needed.
8. Repeat steps 2-8.

      Certainty     /    Relevance
      
Depth   |    Quantity   |    Quantity   |

Breadth  |    Quantity  |    Quantity   |
